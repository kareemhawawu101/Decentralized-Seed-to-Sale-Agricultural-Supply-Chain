# 🌱 Decentralized Seed-to-Sale Agricultural Supply Chain

Welcome to a transformative Web3 solution that creates a transparent, decentralized supply chain for indigenous farmers to track agricultural products from seed to sale on the Stacks blockchain! This project ensures fair trade, prevents counterfeit products, and provides immutable provenance records, empowering farmers and building trust with consumers.

## ✨ Features

🌾 Track crops from planting to market with tamper-proof records  
🔍 Verify product authenticity and origin for consumers  
💸 Enable fair payments to farmers through automated smart contracts  
📦 Manage inventory and logistics with tokenized assets  
🤝 Facilitate direct trade between farmers and buyers, eliminating middlemen  
🔐 Secure farmer and buyer identities with community-verified credentials  
📊 Provide data analytics for yield optimization and market trends  
🛡️ Escrow for secure transactions and dispute resolution  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project uses 9 smart contracts written in Clarity to create a robust, decentralized agricultural supply chain ecosystem. Here's the breakdown:

### Core Smart Contracts
1. **FarmerRegistry.clar**: Registers indigenous farmers with verified credentials (e.g., hashed tribal IDs or community attestations). Only verified farmers can participate in the supply chain.
2. **CropToken.clar**: Mints NFTs representing batches of crops at planting. Each NFT includes metadata like seed type, planting date, and farm location (hashed GPS coordinates).
3. **ProvenanceRegistry.clar**: Tracks the lifecycle of crops (planting, harvesting, processing, shipping) by updating CropToken metadata at each stage. Ensures immutable records.
4. **Marketplace.clar**: Facilitates direct sales between farmers and buyers (e.g., wholesalers, retailers). Supports bidding, fixed pricing, and STX payments.
5. **PaymentEscrow.clar**: Holds funds in escrow during trades, releasing payments to farmers upon delivery confirmation or resolving disputes.
6. **LogisticsTracker.clar**: Records logistics data (e.g., shipping dates, transport methods) linked to CropTokens. Enables buyers to verify delivery timelines.
7. **ConsumerVerification.clar**: Allows consumers to scan a QR code linked to a CropToken to view provenance details, ensuring authenticity and transparency.
8. **AnalyticsHub.clar**: Aggregates anonymized data (e.g., crop yields, market prices) for farmers to optimize production and pricing strategies. Access is permissioned to verified farmers.
9. **Governance.clar**: Enables a DAO-like structure for farmers to vote on platform rules (e.g., transaction fees, dispute arbitrators) using a staked utility token.

**For Farmers**  
- Register as a verified farmer via FarmerRegistry.  
- Mint a CropToken for each crop batch, logging planting details.  
- Update ProvenanceRegistry at each stage (e.g., harvest, processing).  
- List crops on Marketplace for direct sales to buyers.  
- Use AnalyticsHub to optimize yields and pricing.  
- Dispute or verify transactions via PaymentEscrow.  

**For Buyers**  
- Browse verified crop listings on Marketplace.  
- Purchase crops with payments held in PaymentEscrow until delivery.  
- Verify provenance via ConsumerVerification for transparency.  

**For Consumers**  
- Scan QR codes to access CropToken details and confirm authenticity.  

## 🚀 Why It Solves a Real-World Problem

Indigenous farmers often face exploitation by middlemen, counterfeit products diluting their brand, and lack of transparency in supply chains. This project:  
- Ensures fair compensation by enabling direct sales.  
- Prevents counterfeiting with blockchain-based provenance.  
- Builds consumer trust through transparent, verifiable records.  
- Empowers farmers with data to improve productivity and market access.  

## 📝 Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.  
2. Farmers register via FarmerRegistry with community-verified credentials.  
3. Mint CropTokens and update provenance at each stage.  
4. List crops on Marketplace and engage with buyers.  
5. Consumers verify products using ConsumerVerification.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Clarity**: For secure, predictable smart contracts on Stacks.  
- **Stacks Blockchain**: For decentralized, Bitcoin-secured transactions.  
- **Frontend (optional)**: React or Vue.js for a farmer/buyer dashboard.  
- **QR Codes**: For consumer-facing provenance verification.  

This project empowers indigenous farmers, promotes fair trade, and ensures trust in agricultural supply chains! 🌾
